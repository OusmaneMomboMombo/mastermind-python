# Mastermind Game in Python

This repository contains a command-line implementation of the Mastermind game in Python.

## Description

Mastermind is a code-breaking game where you need to guess a secret number. After each guess, the game provides feedback to help you deduce the correct number.

## How to Play

1.  Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
2.  Clone this repository or download the `mastermind_game.py` file.
3.  Run the game using:

    ```
    python mastermind_game.py
    ```

4.  The game will prompt you to enter a 4-digit guess.
5.  The game provides feedback using the following symbols:
    *   `+`: Correct digit and correct position.
    *   `-`: Correct digit but wrong position.
    *   `*`: Incorrect digit.
6.  Keep guessing until you crack the code!

## Example
