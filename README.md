This repository contains a command-line implementation of the Mastermind game in Python.

## Description

Mastermind is a code-breaking game where you need to guess a secret number. After each guess, the game provides feedback to help you deduce the correct number.

2.  Clone this repository or download the `mastermind_game.py` file.
3.  Run the game using:

    *   `+`: Correct digit and correct position.
    *   `-`: Correct digit but wrong position.
    *   `*`: Incorrect digit.
6.  Keep guessing until you crack the code!
